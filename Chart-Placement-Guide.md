**CHART 6: funnel_chart.jpg**
- **Title:** Barriers to Green Chemistry Adoption (Relative Magnitude)
- **Position:** After subsection B (India initiatives) and before subsection C policy coordination
- **Caption:** "Figure 6: Funnel diagram illustrating hierarchy of barriers inhibiting green chemistry implementation. High Initial Capital Investment (100% baseline) represents the primary obstacle, followed by Technical Transition Challenges (75%), Lack of Awareness/Training (55%), Regulatory Uncertainty (35%), and Scale-up Complexity (15%). This distribution indicates that financial incentives and workforce development represent highest-impact intervention points for accelerating adoption."
- **Purpose:** Justifies policy recommendations; guides strategic investment priorities

---

### 📍 **SECTION X: Barriers to Adoption**
**Location:** In subsection A (Technical Challenges)

**CHART 7: radar_chart.jpg**
- **Title:** Comprehensive Green Chemistry Performance Comparison Across Manufacturing Paradigms
- **Position:** After the discussion of barriers and before solutions section
- **Caption:** "Figure 7: Radar chart comparing five sustainability dimensions across four manufacturing approaches: Process Efficiency, Waste Reduction, Safer Chemicals, Energy Efficiency, and Renewable Resources (all 0-100 scale). Traditional Manufacturing lags across all dimensions (15-40 range), Modern Batch shows intermediate improvement (45-60 range), Continuous Flow achieves 55-80 range, while Full Green Chemistry Integration achieves optimal performance (80-92 range). Demonstrates holistic benefits of systematic GC adoption as optimal but intermediate solutions viable."
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive performance visualization; guides implementation pathway selection

## FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS

### For Each Chart, Add:

**Before the chart:**
```
[Start new paragraph or blank line]
```

**After the chart image:**
```
**Figure X: [Title]**

[Caption text - 2-3 sentences explaining the data, key findings, and implications]

[Blank line before continuing text]
```

### Example Implementation:

```
### C. SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Target 7.3 directly addresses energy efficiency... [existing text]

**Energy-Efficient Process Innovation:**

Flow chemistry exemplifies energy-efficient processing... [existing text]

[INSERT CHART 4: pmi_chart.jpg HERE]

**Figure 4: Process Mass Intensity Reduction Trends Across Pharmaceutical Phases (2008-2023)**

This visualization demonstrates consistent 35-55% PMI reductions across pharmaceutical phases over 15 years, directly supporting SDG 12.5 targets and validating the efficacy of systematic green chemistry implementation. The sustained annual reduction rates of 1.4%-1.9% across all phases indicate that measurable, reproducible progress is achievable through deliberate application of green chemistry principles.

## INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MARKDOWN

### Step 1: Where to insert image references
In your markdown file, use the format:
```markdown
![Figure Caption](path-to-image/chart-name.jpg)
```

### Step 2: Optimal formatting in markdown
```markdown
### Section Title

Introductory text here...

---

![Figure 4: Process Mass Intensity Reduction](pmi_chart.jpg)

**Figure 4: Process Mass Intensity Reduction Trends Across Pharmaceutical Phases (2008-2023)**

Caption and explanation here (2-3 sentences).

Continuation of text...
```

### Step 3: Order in document
- Keep figures in logical sequence (1→7)
- Never place two figures immediately adjacent (add text between)
- Ensure each figure is referenced or explained in surrounding text

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES FOR CHART INTEGRATION

✅ **DO:**
- Place figures 1/3 of page width from relevant text discussion
- Ensure captions are descriptive and interpretive (not just data labels)
- Reference each figure in the text (e.g., "As shown in Figure 4...")
- Maintain consistent figure numbering throughout
- Use high-resolution images for publication quality

❌ **DON'T:**
- Place more than one figure per page section
- Use vague captions like "Chart showing data"
- Forget to explain what the chart demonstrates
- Break figure-caption pairs across page boundaries
- Use figures without textual explanation

---
