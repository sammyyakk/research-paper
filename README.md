## Abstract

The present research develops Green Chemistry (GC) as a foundational, preventative molecular framework essential to the attainment of the 2030 SDGs. The analysis shifts the chemical industry beyond simple hazard mitigation and provides direct, systemic linkages between the 12 Principles of GC and key global targets.

The principles of Atom Economy and the Use of Renewable Feedstocks underpin directly SDG 12 on Responsible Consumption and Production and SDG 9 on Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure by significantly improving resource efficiency, reducing waste streams, and contributing to the modernization of chemical production facilities toward benign design innovation.

Further development of catalytic systems, such as enzymatic processes, along with the use of safer solvents, for example Deep Eutectic Solvents/DESs, makes important contributions to SDG 6, Clean Water, and SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy, by reducing toxic releases and lowering the overall energy demands of reactions. GC supports SDG 3 (Health) by focusing on the design of safer chemicals.

The study emphasizes that robust, quantifiable metrics—such as Molar Efficiency—are necessary to transparently measure progress in line with corporate ESG goals. Adoption is hindered by a high initial financial outlay; accelerating policy integration, such as REACH, and corporate leadership are identified as key accelerators. GC is a fundamental approach to the complete transformation of chemical value chains on a global scale toward sustainability.

**Key Words:** SDG 7, GC, ESG, REACH, Sustainability

## I. Introduction

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. The seventeen Sustainable Development Goals represent an urgent call for action by all countries in a global partnership, recognizing that ending poverty must proceed hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth—all while tackling climate change and preserving ecosystems.

At the molecular level, Green Chemistry emerges as the design discipline capable of translating these aspirational goals into tangible chemical reality. Green Chemistry is defined as "the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances," representing a fundamental paradigm shift from end-of-pipe remediation to at-the-source prevention. Unlike traditional approaches that address pollution after its generation, Green Chemistry operates proactively at the molecular design stage, preventing pollution at its source.

The chemical sector stands at the heart of the sustainability challenge. It is foundational to virtually all supply chains—from pharmaceuticals and agriculture to electronics and construction—yet simultaneously bears responsibility for significant environmental burdens. The chemical sector is responsible for 7.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 10% of the world's total energy demand. The sector's transformation is therefore not optional; it is essential for achieving the SDGs.

This paper addresses a critical gap in the literature by systematically mapping the comprehensive interconnections between the complete 12-principle Green Chemistry framework and all relevant SDGs, while integrating quantitative metrics, industrial case studies, policy analysis, and original data within a unified analytical framework. The objectives of this research are fourfold: (1) to establish the theoretical and practical linkages between each Green Chemistry principle and specific SDG targets; (2) to analyze quantitative metrics that enable transparent measurement of progress; (3) to examine industrial case studies demonstrating real-world implementation; and (4) to identify policy frameworks and future directions for accelerated adoption, with particular attention to global perspectives and India's emerging role in sustainable chemistry.

## II. Theoretical Framework: The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry

### A. Historical Evolution and Conceptual Foundation

The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry, articulated by Paul Anastas and John Warner in 1998, emerged from decades of growing environmental awareness and represent a coherent framework for chemical innovation. These principles provide a comprehensive design philosophy that encompasses the entire lifecycle of chemical processes.

The principles are strategically organized into three interconnected categories that reflect different aspects of sustainable chemical practice:

**Efficiency Drivers (Principles 1, 2, 6, 7):**
- **P1: Prevention** - It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it has been created
- **P2: Atom Economy** - Synthetic methods should be designed to maximize the incorporation of all materials into the final product
- **P6: Design for Energy Efficiency** - Energy requirements should be minimized; reactions at ambient temperature and pressure are preferred
- **P7: Use of Renewable Feedstocks** - Raw materials and feedstocks should be renewable rather than depleting

**Hazard Mitigation (Principles 3, 4, 5, 12):**
- **P3: Less Hazardous Chemical Syntheses** - Methods should be designed to use and generate substances with minimal toxicity to human health and the environment
- **P4: Designing Safer Chemicals** - Chemists should design products that maintain efficacy while minimizing toxicity
- **P5: Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries** - Auxiliary substances used in reactions should be unnecessary or replaced with innocuous alternatives
- **P12: Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident Prevention** - Processes should be designed to minimize the potential for chemical accidents, explosions, and fires

**Process and Lifecycle Optimization (Principles 8, 9, 10, 11):**
- **P8: Reduce Derivatives** - Unnecessary derivatization should be avoided or minimized
- **P9: Catalysis** - Catalytic reagents are superior to stoichiometric reagents
- **P10: Design for Degradation** - Products should break down into innocuous substances after use
- **P11: Real-time Analysis for Pollution Prevention** - Analytical methods should enable in-process, real-time monitoring and control

### B. Quantitative Metrics for Green Chemistry Assessment

The translation of qualitative principles into measurable outcomes requires robust metrics that enable rigorous assessment and benchmarking. The evolution of green chemistry metrics has proceeded through several generations, each addressing limitations of predecessors.

**Atom Economy (AE):** Introduced by Barry Trost in 1991, Atom Economy measures theoretical mass efficiency by calculating the proportion of reactant mass that ends up in the desired product:

$$\text{Atom Economy (\%)} = \frac{\text{Molecular Weight of Desired Product}}{\sum \text{Molecular Weight of All Reactants}} \times 100$$

Original source: https://gwern.net/doc/science/chemistry/1991-trost.pdf

While powerful for synthetic planning and comparison of alternative synthetic routes, AE is theoretical and assumes 100% yield, ignoring solvents, catalysts, and workup materials. This limitation necessitated development of more comprehensive metrics.

**E-Factor (Environmental Factor):** Introduced by Roger Sheldon in 1992, the Environmental Factor provides a holistic measure of waste generation in actual processes:

$$\text{E-Factor} = \frac{\text{Total Mass of Waste (kg)}}{\text{Mass of Product (kg)}}$$

30-year retrospective: https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/gc/d2gc04747k

The E-factor quantifies everything except the desired product, including losses from solvents and materials used during workup. Sheldon's analysis of E-factors across industry segments established the following ranges: oil refining (0.1-0.5), bulk chemicals (1-5), fine chemicals (5-50), and pharmaceuticals (25-100+). After 30 years, the E-factor remains the most widely adopted metric for assessing process waste.

**Process Mass Intensity (PMI):** Adopted by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable as the primary benchmarking metric, PMI accounts for all materials—including solvents, reagents, catalysts, and water—used in a chemical process:

$$\text{PMI} = \frac{\text{Total Mass of All Materials Used (kg)}}{\text{Mass of Isolated Product (kg)}}$$

PMI provides the most comprehensive assessment of process efficiency and has become the industry standard for pharmaceutical manufacturing benchmarking. Analysis of synthetic peptide processes reveals median PMI values of 13,000 for solid-phase peptide synthesis, compared to 168-308 for small molecule synthesis, highlighting significant opportunities for process improvement.

**Additional Metrics for Comprehensive Assessment:**

**Renewable Carbon Index (RCI):** Measures the percentage of non-fossil carbon inputs in feedstock, directly supporting SDG 12.2 on sustainable resource management.

**Specific Energy Consumption (SEC):** Quantifies energy use per unit product mass (kWh/kg), enabling direct measurement of progress toward SDG 7.3 on energy efficiency improvement.

**Environmental Quotient (EQ):** Combines E-factor with a qualitative assessment of waste hazard:

$$\text{EQ} = \text{E-Factor} \times Q\text{-value}$$

where the Q-value represents the environmental hazard quotient of the waste.

- **P9 (Catalysis):** Employing efficient catalytic processes
- **P1 & P3 (Prevention & Safety):** One-pot synthesis that reduces waste and avoids toxic reagents

This One Health approach integrates human, animal, and environmental health, representing an emerging framework for pharmaceutical development aligned with multiple SDG targets.

### B. SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

**Target 6.3:** Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials.

Green Chemistry Principles 1, 3, 5, and 10 directly support this objective through waste prevention and safer solvent selection.

**Alternative Solvents as Water Protectants:**

The development of alternative solvents represents a crucial advancement in protecting aquatic ecosystems:

**Ionic Liquids (ILs) and Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs):** These solvents exhibit negligible vapor pressure, excellent thermal stability, and tunable properties that allow targeting specific contaminants. Research demonstrates successful use in extracting pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and heavy metals from contaminated water.

**Supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂):** Operating above critical temperature (31°C) and pressure (72.9 bar), scCO₂ offers:
- Non-toxic, non-flammable, and chemically inert properties
- Easy recovery through pressure reduction
- Tunable solvation power through pressure adjustment
- Industrial applications in pharmaceutical processing and natural product extraction

### E. SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

**Target 12.4:** Achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle.
**Target 12.5:** Substantially reduce waste generation.

SDG 12 represents perhaps the most direct alignment with Green Chemistry. Principles 1, 2, 7, and 8 establish the foundation for responsible production:

**Waste Prevention and Atom Economy:**

The pharmaceutical industry has embraced PMI as the key metric for benchmarking progress. Analysis of manufacturing data reveals that solvent use dominates PMI contributions, with typical syntheses using 80-90% of total mass as solvents. Year-over-year improvements have been achieved across major pharmaceutical companies through:
- Solvent optimization and reduction
- Streamlined synthetic routes

- Continuous manufacturing implementation

**Renewable Feedstocks:**

The bio-based chemical and polymer production now exceeds 90 million tonnes globally. Utilizing renewable resources offers multiple advantages:
- Reduced fossil fuel dependence
- Carbon footprint reduction through renewable resources
- Support for agricultural and biomass valorization sectors
- Resilience through diverse supply chains

Key feedstock sources include lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural residues, waste streams, and industrial byproducts. The biomass balance approach, pioneered by BASF and certified under REDcert², enables tracking of renewable inputs through complex production networks.

**Circular Economy Integration:**

Chemical recycling technologies are projected to receive €8 billion investment by 2030, enabling 3.4 million tonnes of recycled plastic production annually. This represents a transformative shift from linear to circular material flows:
- **Mechanical recycling:** Physical processing of waste plastics (limited by contamination sensitivity and property degradation)
- **Chemical recycling:** Breaking polymers to molecular building blocks through pyrolysis, depolymerization, or gasification

Chemical recycling achieves lower carbon footprints than incineration while enabling true circularity.

## XII. Conclusion

Green Chemistry represents a fundamental approach to the complete transformation of chemical value chains on a global scale toward sustainability. This comprehensive research demonstrates systematic linkages between the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry and key global sustainability targets, providing practical mechanisms for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

Through the integration of robust metrics, industrial case studies, policy analysis, and emerging technologies, Green Chemistry provides the design discipline essential for decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation. The pharmaceutical industry's documented success—from Pfizer's elimination of 1.8 million pounds of hazardous materials to Merck's 25,000-fold improvements in enzymatic activity—demonstrates that Green Chemistry is not aspirational but industrially viable and economically advantageous.

The chemical industry's transformation toward green principles represents one of the most consequential opportunities for achieving global sustainability. By systematically integrating Green Chemistry principles into design, manufacturing, and deployment, the chemical enterprise can advance human health, protect planetary boundaries, and create sustainable economic value simultaneously. The 2030 deadline for SDG achievement makes this transformation not optional but imperative.
